# Box Office Revenue Prediction Tool
Duke MIDS: Cloud Computing Final Project

Link: https://box-office-revenue-prediction.ue.r.appspot.com/

## Objective
Build a machine learning prediction model, deploy it in Flask and Google App Engine, and integrate load testing into our deployment routine.

## Background
The film industry relies on investors and producerâ€™s decisions that are driven by expected box office revenue. The predicted revenue is based on a variety of factors such as the month of release, marketing, reputation of the studio, and more. We present the development of a box office revenue prediction tool based on [previous work](https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/eda-feature-engineering-and-model-interpretation) in this space and take it into production to make it available for the public.

## Architecture
This project emulates the following workflow:


1. Build a machine learning model to predict box office revenue using XGBoost. The data comes from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). Store the model code as a .pkl object that will be used in the next step.

2. Create a Flask application that consists of the following items:
3. HTML file for the frontend: allows the user to input values; in this case, the name of the movie.
4. CSS file for styling the web interface (fonts, buttons, background, etc.)
5. requirements.txt file to import all the necessary packages.
6. main.py file that accesses the model.pkl and data files to display information to the user.
7. Deploy the Flask application in Google App Engine standard environment. 
8. Access the resulting web interface and perform functional testing.
